= Test the KK board =
Please load the firmware you need. You could refer to firmware transfer wiki page for more details.

Here I use Quadrocopter, X mode
  * Firmware: KKXcopter 1.0 Quad Firmware by Minsoo Kim

== 1. Connect receiver to KK board ==
  * Make sure the direction is correct!
  * `[`Signal Vcc Gnd`]` or `[`Gnd Vcc Signal`]` ? DOUBLE CHECK IT!
  * Not only Check each pin!
  * Also Check which channel is AIL, ELE, THR, ROD!

*IT WONT WORK IF ANY STEP GO WRONG*


== 2. Connect 4 ESCs to KK board ==
  * Make sure the direction is correct!
  * `[`Signal Vcc Gnd`]` or `[`Gnd Vcc Signal`]` ? DOUBLE CHECK IT!
  * Not only Check each pin!
  * Also Check which channel is which motor! It depends on which firmware you use!

== 3. Setting transmitter channels ==

|| *CHANNEL* || *Aileron* || *Elevator* || *Throttle* || *Rudder* ||	
|| JR/SPEKTRUM || REVERSE || REVERSE || NORMAL || REVERSE || 
|| WFLY/FUTABA || NORMAL || NORMAL || REVERSE || NORMAL || 
|| HITEC || NORMAL || REVERSE || NORMAL || NORMAL || 
|| Others || ? || ? || ? ||  	 	 	 

- Make sure you do not have any mixing switches on your Transmitter enabled.

IT WONT WORK IF ANY STEP ABOVE GO WRONG



== 4.Stick Centering ==


=== 1. set all to middle (50%)===
<img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/23905563/projects/copter/wiki/getting%20started/centering.jpg>

=== 2. set YAW gain to minimal (0%), CLOCKWISE!!! ===

=== 3. Put throttle stick to Full (100%) and turn on the transmitter ===

=== 4. Power up the quadrocopter (receiver and kk board).===
You will hear 3 beeps from ESCs and it beeps continuously with 3 states.
  * beep
  * beep beep
  * beep beep beep

When the state is "beep beep", Put throttle stick to 0%.

You will hear beep to confirm the choice.

=== 5. Restart and try to Arm you KK board. ===
